## 🧠 What is Data Engineering?

**Data Engineering** is the discipline of **designing, building, and maintaining systems** that collect, store, and process data at scale. It forms the backbone of **data-driven decision-making**, enabling analysts, data scientists, and applications to access clean, reliable, and timely data.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Before running any scripts in this repository, configure your **environment variables** in a `.env` file. This ensures your **API keys** and **database credentials** remain secure and are not hard-coded in scripts.

### 1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory

```bash
touch .env
```

### 2. Add Your Credentials

Include your API keys and database configurations in the `.env` file:

```ini
# 🌦️ OpenWeatherMap API Key
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# 🗄️ PostgreSQL Database
HOST=your_postgres_host
USER=your_postgres_user
PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DATABASE=weather_retail_db

# 🍃 MongoDB Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://your_user:your_password@host:port
MONGO_DB=weather_retail_db
```

⚠️ **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub. Add it to `.gitignore`.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
