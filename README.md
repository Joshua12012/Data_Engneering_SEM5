📊 Introduction to Data Engineering

Welcome to my Data Engineering repository! 🚀
This repo documents my journey as a college student exploring the foundational concepts, tools, and workflows that power modern data infrastructure. Inside, you’ll find notes, hands-on exercises, and project work that cover both theory and practice.

🧠 What is Data Engineering?

Data Engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and maintaining systems that collect, store, and process data at scale. It forms the backbone of data-driven decision-making, enabling analysts, data scientists, and applications to access clean, reliable, and timely data.

🛠️ Core Responsibilities of a Data Engineer

Data Collection → Ingesting data from APIs, databases, and files

Data Cleaning & Transformation → Ensuring high data quality through preprocessing and formatting

Data Storage → Designing schemas and managing relational or non-relational databases

Pipeline Development → Automating workflows with tools like Apache Airflow or Spark

Performance Optimization → Building scalable and efficient systems

🧰 Common Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools/Technologies
Programming	Python, SQL
Data Storage	PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, BigQuery
Data Pipelines	Apache Airflow, Luigi, Prefect
Big Data	Apache Spark, Hadoop
Cloud Platforms	AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
ETL Tools	Talend, Informatica, dbt
⚙️ Setup Instructions

Before running any scripts in this repo, please make sure you configure your environment variables in a .env file.
This ensures your API keys and database credentials remain secure and are not hard-coded in the scripts.

1. Create a .env file in the root directory:
touch .env

2. Add your credentials:
# 🌦️ OpenWeatherMap API Key
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# 🗄️ PostgreSQL Database
HOST=your_postgres_host
USER=your_postgres_user
PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DATABASE=weather_retail_db

# 🍃 MongoDB Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://your_user:your_password@host:port
MONGO_DB=weather_retail_db


⚠️ Never commit your .env file to GitHub. Add it to .gitignore.

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
