## üß† What is Data Engineering?

Data Engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and maintaining systems that collect, store, and process data at scale. It serves as the backbone of data-driven decision-making in organizations, enabling analysts, data scientists, and applications to access clean, reliable, and timely data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Responsibilities of a Data Engineer

- **Data Collection**: Ingesting data from various sources (APIs, databases, files, etc.)
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Ensuring data quality through preprocessing and formatting
- **Data Storage**: Designing efficient schemas and managing databases or data lakes
- **Data Pipeline Development**: Automating workflows using tools like Apache Airflow or Spark
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring scalability and speed in data systems
